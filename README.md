# About Me
Hello! I'm Duncan Grimes, a backend software engineer with passions for machine learning and data science. I build REST APIs and databases to support [ShopYourLikes](https://www.shopyourlikes.com/), a platform that empowers influencers to monetize their content by posting retail affiliate links.

I graduated from Vanderbilt University in Spring 2025, with degrees in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, and a minor in Business.

Please enjoy reading checking out some personal projects I've worked!
